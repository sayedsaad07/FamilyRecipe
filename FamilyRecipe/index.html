            <p>Recently, I found my wife asking around for food recipes. Once, She might get recipes from family and friends.</p>
            <p>I found myself interested in finding food recipes for her. I started asking my colleagues about their favorite dishes. </p>
            <p>For me, the only thing I’m interested in the what is my wife is cooking Today!! </p>
            <p>Since cooking and eating is a daily routine. Why shall I ask the same question every single day!!</p>
